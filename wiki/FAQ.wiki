_How does Nighthawk's current ARP spoofing implementation work?_

It works the same way that others do - it repeatedly sends fake ARP responses to selected targets and attempts to redirect any communication between selected clients and a gateway through the attacker's computer.

_How does "SSL stripping" work?_

After a successful network traffic redirection, SSL stripping tries to force HTTP's "Accept-Encoding" to plain (we hate gzip :-) ) and modifies "If-Modified-Since" dates to attempt to prevent the browser from using a cached copy of a web page. Then it searches for any occurances of "https" links (or form actions) and changes them to "http". This way, any data sent through a form is in plain text and Nighthawk's sniffer can pick it up.

_What does "Strip cookies" do?_

It basically strips all information regarding cookies from HTTP request and ends any "logged in" session, forcing the user to login again and therefore allowing Nighthawk to capture login information.

_What can Nighthawk's sniffer actually sniff?_

Currently it only looks for HTTP authentication data (403), FTP logins and most common field names (used in login forms) inside GET/POST requests.
